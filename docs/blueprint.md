- Dynamic Content Search: Implement dynamic content search, with filters by group and tags.
- UX Enhancements: Add toast notifications for saving, deleting, or downloading, lightweight image previews, and a dark/light theme toggle.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated blue (#5F9EA0) for a calm, organized feel, aligning with content management. This avoids the cliche of using bright colors for organization apps but maintains a professional look.
- Background color: A dark gray (#333333) to provide a modern dark theme, enhancing the focus on content.
- Accent color: A light orange (#FFB347) analogous to blue, for interactive elements to draw attention without disrupting the overall aesthetic.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a humanist sans-serif for headlines to reflect modern style, art, and design
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font to match headline font and display long texts in a fashion, art, and design style.
- Use a set of simple, minimalist icons for content types, groups, and actions to maintain a clean and intuitive interface.
- Implement a responsive dashboard layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations for transitions, loading states, and user interactions to enhance the overall user experience.
